In this solution, the **[STEVAL-PROTEUS1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-proteus1.html)** series microcontroller acts as the BLE node, transmitting sensor data. The application sets up the **[STM32MPU](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-arm-cortex-mpus.html)** as the **AWS IoT Greengrass BLE Sensor Gateway**, allowing it to securely transmits data from the STEVAL-PROTEUS1 devices to AWS IoT Core for processing, analytics, and integration with other AWS services. Additionally, the solution supports remote deployment to the STM32MPU devices operating **[Greengrass Lite](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-nucleus-lite-component.html)** in the field, providing flexibility for managing remote and distributed sensor networks.

### What is AWS IoT Greengrass?

AWS IoT Greengrass is a service that extends AWS to edge devices, allowing them to act locally on the data they generate. It enables local execution of AWS Lambda functions, message brokering, data caching, and synchronization with AWS cloud services, even when the devices are offline. Greengrass helps you manage remote devices at scale, securely deploy applications, and keep devices up-to-date with remote software updates. 

#### What is AWS IoT Greengrass Lite?

The Greengrass nucleus lite is a device runtime for constrained edge devices optimized for minimal memory footprint (uses less than 5MB RAM). It has been introduced with AWS IoT Greengrass version 2.14.0 release and is backward compatible with AWS IoT Greengrass generic components, Greengrass V2 API, and SDK.

### AWS IoT Greengrass Remote Deployment

The **BLE Gateway** is packaged as an **[AWS IoT Greengrass V2 component](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-components.html)**, enabling seamless **[remote deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/create-deployments.html)** onto **STM32MPU** devices with the provided `deploy.sh` script. 
This setup allows you to:

1. **Manage Devices at Scale**: Easily deploy and manage your sensor networks in remote locations without requiring direct interaction with each device.
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously collect data from sensors in the field and monitor it in real time in **AWS IoT Core**.
3. **Remote Firmware Updates**: Push updates to devices remotely, ensuring they remain up-to-date with minimal intervention.
4. **Edge Computing**: Run **AWS Lambda** functions on the edge to process data locally, reducing latency and bandwidth usage by sending only relevant data to the cloud.

   - **[STM32MP1_AWS-IoT-Greengrass-nucleus-lite](https://github.com/stm32-hotspot/STM32MP1_AWS-IoT-Greengrass-nucleus-lite)**
   



### **4. Deploy the Component**
   The BLE Gateway Component is packaged as a Greengrass V2 Component and deployment is automated with **`deploy.sh`**. 

   1. **Configure `config.json`**
      The `config.json` file contains essential parameters for deploying the **BleGateway** component using AWS Greengrass. Follow the instructions below to correctly populate the fields.  


      ##### **Parameter Descriptions**
      | **Key**              | **Description** |
      |----------------------|---------------|
      | `TARGET_NAME`       | The name of the AWS IoT Thing or Group that will receive the Greengrass deployment. Example: `"MyGreengrassDevice"` or `"MyGreengrassGroup"`. |
      | `BASE_BUCKET_NAME`   | The base name for the AWS S3 bucket where artifacts will be stored. Your AWS account ID will be appended to this name automatically. |
      | `REGION`            | The AWS region where your resources (S3 bucket, Greengrass component, IoT Thing) are located. Example: `"us-west-2"`. |
      | `VERSION`          | The version number of the component. This should match the version of your deployment. Example: `"1.0.0"`. |
      | `COMPONENT_NAME`    | The name of the AWS Greengrass component being deployed. Example: `"com.example.BleGateway"`. |

      ##### **Example `config.json` File**
      ```json
      {
         "TARGET_NAME": "MyGreengrassDevice",
         "BASE_BUCKET_NAME": "ble-gateway",
         "REGION": "us-west-2",
         "VERSION": "1.0.0",
         "COMPONENT_NAME": "com.example.BleGateway"
      }
      ```


      >##### **Notes:**
      >- Ensure that **`BASE_BUCKET_NAME`** is unique across AWS (your account ID helps with this).  
      >- The **`TARGET_NAME`** should match an existing AWS IoT Thing **OR** Group Name.
      >- **Creating New Versions or Modifying Artifacts:**  
      >     - If you create a new version or modify artifacts (e.g., `BleGateway.py`, `install.sh`), place them in a directory corresponding to the new version.  
      >     - The script expects artifacts to be in:  
      >        ```./BleGatewayComponent/artifacts/com.example.BleGateway/<VERSION>/```
      >     - This ensures the deployment script can find and upload the correct files.

   2. **Run `Deploy.sh`**

      ##### **Prerequisites**  
      - **AWS CLI** [installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/).  
      - A properly filled `config.json`

      ##### **Running the Script**  
      ```sh
      cd GG_BLE_GATEWAY
      chmod +x deploy.sh  # Ensure it's executable (only needed once)
      ./deploy.sh
      ```
      This will:  
      - Load settings from `config.json`.  
      - Upload artifacts (`BleGateway.py`, `install.sh`) to S3.  
      - Update the component recipe.  
      - Create and deploy the component in AWS Greengrass.  

### **5. Viewing MQTT Messages in AWS IoT Core**  

   To monitor and debug MQTT messages from your AWS Greengrass BLE Gateway, use the AWS IoT MQTT test client:  

   1. **Open AWS IoT Core**  
      - Sign in to the [AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot).  
      
   2. **Access the MQTT Test Client**  
      - In the left navigation pane, select **Test** under **Message Routing**.  
      
   3. **Subscribe to Topics**  
      - Enter the topic filter (e.g., `HTSTM/temp/`) and choose **Subscribe to topic**.  
      
   4. **Publish and View Messages**  
      - Monitor incoming messages or send test messages to your IoT Core topics.
